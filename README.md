# dc-crypto
A crypto-tracking app to engage and empower users and devs alike. 

## Why are we building this app?
We aim to build an app that will be used for the educational purposes of teaching a full stack app development process with various sections of the app that can be refactored to utilize various other technologies (e.g. GraphQL, React Hooks, PWA, Websockets). 

This educational project inspiration was borne of our own desires to build a better tool to track and engage with cryptocurrencies and their surrounding ecosystem.
